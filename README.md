# FileQ - Lightweight File Queue Service

**FileQ** is a lightweight, topic-based file queue system built with **Spring Boot**.  
It enables **producers** to upload files to named topics and **consumers** to pull, process, and complete them via simple REST APIs.

This is ideal for workflows where files need to be processed asynchronously in a **queue-like** manner without a heavy message broker.
